			<p class="bold"> Socials (Flutter Application Development) </p>
		    <p class="font"> A multi-platform social media app with a new view into the social world. Made the whole application from scratch and with a noSQL database backend Firebase. All the networking, backend and security and other functions are being handled by me. Not released yet but the binaries have been developed and is undergoing testing and bug ﬁxes. </p>

			<p class="bold"> Lyrics Generator (Tensorﬂow & Flask) </p>
			<p class="font"> A project that started with some scraping of lyrics of various artist from a website which ended up being a dataset for a Natural Language Processing project, which takes the lyrics, tokenises it and learns the sequences and regenerate some new ones, which hopefully make sense to the user. It was later coupled with ﬂask to make it into a website. You would ﬁnd it on <u>lyrics.ﬂads.in/</u> if we upgrade our website system to a better plan. All the work except for designing the website UI was done by me. The work is open source which can be seen on Github. </p>

			<p class="bold"> Denial of Service Script (Python, Networking & Cybersecurity) </p> 
			<p class="font"> This incorporation of the CPU intensive hulk dos script written in python2 into python3. Made some major library changes on par with the original work. Works pretty good on basic small server website. The script is not open source due to security concerns. </p>

	        <p class="bold"> Personal Website (Flutter Web) </p>
			<p class="font"> A personal website <u>www.shubhendusingh.in</u> made with the help of the new framework by google Flutter Web. </p>

			<p class="bold"> Certiﬁcate Generator (Flask, Python) </p>
			<p class="font"> During the trying times of Covid-19 people organising webinars were in need to provide the certiﬁcates for the same. Made the same using Python and Flask. Looks shabby but works ﬁne. Can be found at <u>certiﬁcate.ﬂads.in</u> . The project is open source. </p>

			<p class="bold"> Terminal Messenger (Network Programming) </p>
			<p class="font"> Wrote an amusingly low level script where a client and server can message through the terminal using the UDP protocol. </p>

			<p class="bold"> Object Detection using YOLO (Computer Vision) </p>
			<p class="font" > Wrote a low frame rate openCV implementation of the YOLO object detection model used in self driving projects which detects objects from the computer webcam at very high accuracy. </p>

            <p class="bold"> XY-Fit (tensorﬂowjs) </p>
            <p class="font"> Website that asks the user to map some x values to their y values and some hyper parameters. Our model then tries to understand the relation between them and predicts Testing Values. Completely open source. </p>
